\brief SHARMWindow class defining a window where a user can specificy the inputs to 
a spherical harmonics gravity coefficients computation

\details This class inherits from AnalysesWindow and enables the
user to set a number of options used in the spherical harmonics gravity coefficients calculation.
The calculation can only take place if a spacecraft or a small body shape model is available and if an output directory 
has been specified
